# Evolution (Trailer)

In the story, elf and humans are not separated from each other at first, and belong to the same group. Over time, some creatures evolved to form humans. This claim is mentioned many times in the story, but it has not been confirmed. Mew is considered to be the ancestor of elf, and it evolved into other elf. The earliest humans were born in the Stone Age millions of years ago. In biology and genetics, all elf belong to different branches of the same species, so even elf of different species may lay eggs in the breeding room.

In the Elfworld, the term evolution specifically refers to the process by which the elf grows to a certain stage or transforms into another elf under certain conditions. Evolution is not just about getting bigger. Elf in the general evolution form has a stronger race value, learns different moves, and even changes attributes. Many elf can evolve.
