# Type

The elves are divided into 18 type according to their type, and they can have one or two typ. For example,Charmander is a Fire type, while Bulbasaur is both a Grass type and a Poison type. There is no dual-type elf with the same first type as the second type (unless it is an error elf).

There is a relationship between restraint and resistance between type. If you use the skill's type to restrain the opponent's elf's type, it will cause greater damage, and if you are resisted by the opponent, the damage will be relatively small. Ineffective attacks can't bring harm.

When the elves use the same type as their own type, the damage will be higher.
