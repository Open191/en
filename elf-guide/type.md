# Type

Elves are divided into seven attributes based on their characteristics.

The 7 properties are as follows: Ground, Fire, Water, Grass, Electric, Psychic, Ghost

There is a relationship between the attributes of restraint and resistance. If you use your ability's stats to control your opponent's pokemon stats, you will deal more damage, and less damage if you are resisted. Ineffective attacks do no damage.

The amount of damage a wisp deals when it uses a move with the same stats as its own is higher.
