# Type

Elves are divided into 7 type according to their features.

The 7 type are as follows.: Ground, Fire, Water, Grass, Electric, Psychic, Ghost

There is a restraint and resistance relationship between attributes. If the attribute of the skill used restrains the attribute of the opponent elf, it will cause more damage, and if it is resisted by the opponent, the damage will be less. Invalid attacks are even less able to bring damage.

When an elf uses a move with the same attributes as its own, the damage dealt will be higher.
