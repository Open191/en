### Pichu <a href="#pichu" id="pichu"></a>

![](../.gitbook/assets/pichu.png)

It is usually found in groups and often touch tails with other Pichu as a show of courage, creating a shower of sparks that can make them cry. It is inept at storing electricity and may discharge if amused, startled, or subjected to shock. However, it cannot discharge without being shocked itself. Charging up is more easily done on days of dryness or with thunderclouds. The crackling of static electricity generated by Pichu is audible. It can zap an adult human but will surprise itself if it does.

### Zubat <a href="#zubat" id="zubat"></a>

![](../.gitbook/assets/Zubat.png)

### Abra <a href="#abra" id="abra"></a>

![](../.gitbook/assets/Abra.png)

It can sense danger through a telepathic radar. When it does, it teleports to a safe location. However, it sometimes becomes panicked if it wakes in an unknown location. By hypnotizing itself, it is able to teleport itself even while sleeping. It can use other extrasensory abilities while sleeping as well and can even teleport into the treetops to pick and eat berries. The deeper sleeps, the farther it teleports. Due to the strain of its telepathic powers, however, it sleeps 18 hours each day. If it fails to rest long enough, it will become unable to use its powers. The contents in it's dream can affect its powers.
