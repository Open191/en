# Feature Information

Elf is a new species of NFT based on the ERC-721 protocol. Some elves live in harmony with humans, and some live in the mountains. One of their main characteristics is that they can be subdued by elfball so that they can be carried with them. The exact number of elves is unknown, there are hundreds of species currently known, and more elves will be discovered in the future. Each kind of elf can hatch more than one according to the ID number.

When the Elf World was first released, a total of 8,000 creation elves will be generated in the form of blind boxes. In addition, 1,000 creation elves can be captured in the wild adventure, and the rest of the elves are all hatched from the 9,000 creation elves.

Each elf includes gender, type, stat, ability, rarity and egg group to which it belongs.
