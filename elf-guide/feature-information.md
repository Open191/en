# Feature Information

Elf is a new species of NFT based on the ERC-721 protocol. Some elves live in harmony with humans, and some live in the mountains. One of their main characteristics is that they can be subdued by elfball so that they can be carried with them. The exact number of elves is unknown, there are hundreds of species currently known, and more elves will be discovered in the future. Each kind of elf can hatch more than one according to the id number, but in principle, each number will not exceed 1000. When it is first released in the elfworld, a total of 16,000 creation elves will be generated in the form of blind boxes. The rest of the elves were all spawned from these 16,000 hatches.

Each elf includes gender, type, stat, ability, rarity and egg group to which it belongs.
