Elves are **NFT characters cast to ERC-721 standards** and can be used by the players to earn passive income. Players are allowed to use Elfball to collect elves and earn **ELFT** through training, dueling and other strategies. There are more fun application scenarios coming soon.

The game runs on the **BSC (Binance Chain) network**, which will ensure **very low transaction costs.** It is compatible with web3 wallets such as MetaMask for accepting transactions and paying gas fees. MetaMask can be installed as a browser extension or as an app on mobile devices.
