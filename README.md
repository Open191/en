Elfs are NFT characters cast in according to **ERC-721 standard** and can be traded in our market. Game players are allowed to use elfball to collect elf, and **earn ELFT** through training, duel and other strategies. There will be more interesting application scenarios coming soon.

The game **runs on the BSC (Binance Smart Chain) network**, which will ensure that **transaction costs are very low**. Compatible with web3 wallets such as MetaMask, used to accept transactions and pay gas fees. MetaMask can be installed as a browser extension or as an application on a mobile device.
