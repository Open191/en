# Withdraw ELFT

The withdraw system works on an individual basis, each person will have a different fee depending on how long he/she has been waiting between withdrawals.

We know that when panic situations are generated, people can be influenced to sell. Our way to counteract these situations is as follows:

The Withdraw rate will start from 75%. Every day it will be reduced by 5% until it reaches the minimum, 5%. 60% of the withdraw rate will go to burn token, which will result in a significant increase in value. So when a person panic sells, something that should hurt the market, he will be benefiting the ELFT, since if the rate is high, he will be contributing to burn a lot of tokens.

Every day is reduced by 5% which would be the withdraw rate:

| Date of Waiting | Rate |
| --------------- | ---- |
| 0               | 75%  |
| 1               | 70%  |
| 2               | 65%  |
| 3               | 60%  |
| 4               | 55%  |
| 5               | 50%  |
| 6               | 45%  |
| 7               | 40%  |
| 8               | 35%  |
| 9               | 30%  |
| 10              | 25%  |
| 11              | 20%  |
| 12              | 15%  |
| 13              | 10%  |
| 14              | 5%   |

Once we remove it, the day counter will start again.

Practical examples:

* Case 1:Withdraw 100 ELFT. If you choose to arrive in 3 days, the withdrawal fee will be 60%. After the 5th day, 40 ELFT will be received. Pay 60 ELFT (100\*60%) as a handling fee, of which 36 ELFT (5\*60%) will be used for destruction.
* Case 2:Withdraw 100 ELFT. If you choose to arrive within 14 days, the withdrawal fee will be at least 5%. After the 14th day, 95 ELFT will be received. Pay 5 ELFT(100\*5%) as a handling fee, of which 3 ELFT tokens (5\*60%) will be used for destruction.
