The first-level recommendation address and the second-level recommendation address enjoy 1% of the token recommender reward).

The deflation stop rule when the total amount reaches 21 million: 2% of the destruction of each transfer and 2% of the fund pool tax and fees are automatically stopped (automatically executed in the contract). The 2% referral bonus tax remains the same. The various income destruction parts in the game are also automatically stopped. The total amount remains unchanged thereafter.
