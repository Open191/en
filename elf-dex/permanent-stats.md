#### HP

The HP bar is one of the six basic ability values. It represents the life value of an elf. When the elf is damaged, the HP will be reduced, and when the HP is reduced to 0, it will enter a state of dying. The lost HP can be restored with specific props and moves.

#### Attack

Attack is a type of elf ability. The high-attack elf uses moves that cause high damage.

#### Defense

Defense is a kind of elf ability. In battle, the elf will use defensive moves to resist the enemy's attack and cause HP to drop. The defensive elves receive less damage from attacks.

#### Speed

Speed is a special ability value in the ability. Normally, it doesn't participate in the damage calculation. The elves with high speed ability will move first than those with low speed ability. If the speed is the same, the attack sequence is random.
