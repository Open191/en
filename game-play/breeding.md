# Breeding (Trailer)

Almost all elfin can breed, and genderless elfin can lay eggs with Ditto. Only the elfin of the lowest form and the elfin who have not found the egg group, there are all kinds of monsters that cannot lay eggs. The elfin of the lowest form can only reproduce after they have evolved. Like real-world creatures, many elfin have genders, and some elfin can be distinguished by gender differences. Usually, the way elfin reproduce is not known or seen.

#### Elf egg

The elf lives in the elf egg before it is born, and the elf egg has a hard shell to protect its growth. Just like animals in the real world, elfin will do their best to protect their elfin and keep them close to them. After growing to a certain level, the elf will hatch from the egg. The time it takes for the elf to hatch varies depending on the type of elf, but if the elf egg is stored in the computer, the growth of the egg will be suspended.

#### Inheritance

The hatched elfin may inherit the form, moves, individual value, personality and characteristics of their parents.

#### More gameplay

Elfin will continue to introduce new and different aspects of gameplay, coming soon...
