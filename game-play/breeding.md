# Breeding

Almost all elf can breed, and genderless elf can lay eggs with Ditto. Only the elf of the lowest form and the elf who have not found the egg group, there are all kinds of monsters that cannot lay eggs. The elf of the lowest form can only reproduce after they have evolved. Like real-world creatures, many elf have genders, and some elf can be distinguished by gender differences. Usually, the way elf reproduce is not known or seen.

#### Elf egg

The elf lives in the elf egg before it is born, and the elf egg has a hard shell to protect its growth. Just like animals in the real world, elf will do their best to protect their elf and keep them close to them. After growing to a certain level, the elf will hatch from the egg. The time it takes for the elf to hatch varies depending on the type of elf, but if the elf egg is **stored in the computer**, the growth of the egg **will be suspended**.

#### Breeding mechanics

Breeding requires the use of two elves.

Genesis elf breeding conditions: male and female belonging to the same egg group can reproduce,

Non-genesis elf breeding conditions: two fairies of the same breed, male and female, can breed.

The lowest form of elf can reproduce only after it has evolved (except for non-evolved elf).

Asexual elves can only breed with Ditto, which can breed with any elves except the lowest form of pixies.

Each elf can breed up to seven times.

Fairies of the same father or mother cannot reproduce, and parents cannot reproduce with their offspring.

Male elf breeding cool-off period is 0.

The female elf must wait for the eggs to hatch before she is allowed to start another round of reproduction.

Only one fairy egg can be produced per breeding. The fairy egg belongs to the female, and the male gets a quarter of the breeding fee.

#### Breeding fee

| Breeding times | Fee（ELFT） | Fee（EP） |
| -------------- | --------- | ------- |
| 1              | 80        | 1000    |
| 2              | 160       | 1500    |
| 3              | 240       | 2500    |
| 4              | 320       | 3500    |
| 5              | 400       | 6000    |
| 6              | 480       | 10000   |
| 7              | 600       | 15000   |

#### Hatch

Elf eggs need to be sent to the incubation house for incubation, and players need to pay ELFT and EP (Elf Potions), depending on the number of times they hatch. The ELFT fee component is variable and can be adjusted from time to time based on economic factors.

The incubation cycle is calculated based on the female's rarity (multiply with Ditto and compute in periods that are not Ditto squared).

According to the number of births, plus reproductive loss. Add 2 days for each child. For example, second birth loss plus 2 days.

| Rarity | Incubation cycle |
| ------ | ---------------- |
| N      | 14 Days          |
| R      | 13 Days          |
| SR     | 12 Days          |
| SSR    | 11 Days          |
| UR     | 10 Days          |

In the future, there will be more new ways for elves to incubate eggs in their own houses.

#### Genetic mechanism

From the elf eggs hatch the lowest form of elf.

It takes two genesis elves to spawn a new NFT character.

Gendered elves are now randomly assigned according to the sex ratio of NFT characters.

The elf's regular ability is to randomize between parents.
