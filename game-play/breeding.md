# Breeding

Elf in their baby form can only reproduce after they have evolved.. Like real world creatures, many elves have a gender distinction, and some elves can be identified by gender differences. Generally, the way elves reproduce is not known or seen.

#### Elf Egg

The elf lives in the elf egg before it is born, and the elf egg has a hard shell to protect its growth. Just like animals in the real world, elf will do their best to protect their elf and keep them close to them. After growing to a certain level, the elf will hatch from the egg. The time it takes for the elf to hatch varies depending on the type of elf, but if the elf egg is **stored in the computer**, the growth of the egg **will be suspended**.

#### Breeding Mechanics

It has to be a spirit of the opposite sex.

You can use any variety of NFT characters.

And parents cannot reproduce with their offspring.

Only elves in adult and ultimate form can reproduce. Elf in baby form cannot reproduce.

Neither elf has reproduced more than seven times.

Players who use the female elf pay ELFT as breeding fees.

The cooling-off period for male and female elves is the same as the incubation period. After the cooling-off period, a new round of breeding is allowed.

#### Breeding Fee

Players need to pay ELFT to reproduce, which is determined by the number of reproductions. The ELFT fee portion is variable and can be adjusted at any time based on economic factors.

| Breeding Times | Fee（ELFT） |
| -------------- | --------- |
| 1              | 200       |
| 2              | 300       |
| 3              | 500       |
| 4              | 800       |
| 5              | 1300      |
| 6              | 2100      |
| 7              | 3400      |

30% of the reproduction cost will be automatically destroyed, and the rest will be used as project income.

#### Incubation

Fairy eggs need to be sent to the incubation house for incubation.

The incubation cycle is calculated based on the female elf's rarity.

According to the number of births, plus reproductive loss. Add 2 days for each child. For example, second birth loss plus 2 days.

**Genesis Elf Incubation Cycle**

| Rarity | Incubation Cycle |
| ------ | ---------------- |
| N      | 7 Days           |
| R      | 7 Days           |
| SR     | 7 Days           |
| SSR    | 7 Days           |
| GR     | 7 Days           |
| UR     | 7 Days           |

**Non-Genesis Elf incubation Cycle**

| Rarity | Incubation Cycle |
| ------ | ---------------- |
| N      | 12 Days          |
| R      | 11 Days          |
| SR     | 10 Days          |
| SSR    | 9 Days           |
| GR     | 8 Days           |
| UR     | 7 Days           |

In the future, there will be more new ways for elves to incubate eggs in their own houses.

#### Reproduce the Results

You can only get 1 fairy egg per breeding.

Female elf players receive spawn elf eggs.

Male elf players receive a quarter of the reproduction fee in return.

From the fairy eggs hatch the lowest form of elf.

The elves reproduce to produce offspring elves, and the offspring's regular abilities have a random probability of plus or minus 10% according to the offspring's own NFT character value.

Two sprites may spawn new NFT characters, and their rarity determines the probability that their offspring will have high rarity.
