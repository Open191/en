# Day Care (Trailer)

The breeding house is a commercial place for breeding and incubating eggs operated by Day-Care Couple. Players can deposit elfin and elf eggs and need to pay $ELF tokens.

#### Breeding

If two elfin that meet the breeding rules are deposited in the Day Care, it is possible to obtain elf eggs. If there are no elfin that comply with the breeding rules in the Day Care, you will not be able to get the elfin for the time being, and you need to continue to wait for other players to deposit the elfin.

#### Hatchin eggs

The elf egg needs to be deposited in the Day Care to hatch the elfin. When the elf egg is stored outside the Day Care, the growth of the egg will be suspended. The egg incubation time depends on the incubation cycle of this elfin. Like a highly rare or powerful elfin, the incubation cycle will be particularly long.

#### More gameplay

Elfin will continue to introduce new and different aspects of gameplay, coming soon...
