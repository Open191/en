# Day Care (Trailer)

The breeding house is a commercial place for breeding and incubating eggs operated by Day-Care Couple. Players can deposit elf and elf eggs and need to pay ELFT.

#### Breeding

If two elf that meet the breeding rules are deposited in the Day Care, it is possible to obtain elf eggs. If there are no elf that comply with the breeding rules in the Day Care, you will not be able to get the elf for the time being, and you need to continue to wait for other players to deposit the elf.

#### Hatchin eggs

The elf egg needs to be deposited in the Day Care to hatch the elf. When the elf egg is stored outside the Day Care, the growth of the egg will be suspended. The egg incubation time depends on the incubation cycle of this elf. The egg hatching time depends on the elf's incubation cycle, such as the rarer or more powerful elf, the shorter the hatching cycle will be.

#### More gameplay

Elf will continue to introduce new and different aspects of gameplay, coming soon...
