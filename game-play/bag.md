#### Equipment

Elf can wear headgear, collar, glove, super headgear, bell, stopwatch, pokeball, etc. There are 6 equipment parts in total, and each part is common to all elves. The equipment can improve the armor, damage, crit, magic resistance, anti-explosion, evasion, etc. of the elf, and each piece of equipment can enhance up to 2 general abilities.

Equipment is divided into 5 quality levels: white < green < blue < purple < orange (a halo surrounds the icon), among which only orange equipment can be upgraded. Each upgrade requires a gift certificate, which is determined according to the equipment level. Non-orange equipment can be smelted in the backpack with one click, the altar devours the equipment, and then the smelting enhancement stone and EG are ejected.
